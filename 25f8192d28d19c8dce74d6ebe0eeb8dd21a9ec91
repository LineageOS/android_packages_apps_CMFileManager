      "message": "Yes, one is to delete a set of paths, the other is to add.  I could potentially combine them, but that will increase total memory usage on something I\u0027m already iffy about doing since there is a potential to get an OOM on directories with a very large number of files. Maybe the better implementation would be to do a scanFile on a per-directory basis as we recursively scan through the folder.",
