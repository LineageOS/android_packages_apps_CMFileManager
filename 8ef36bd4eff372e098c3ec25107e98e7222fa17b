      "message": "i think we might be masking the problem by adding a null check. I see that the mWorkerThread stops if cancel or end is called on the thread. If we got a null here, then did the worker thread die prematurely? Also check the cancelled boolean, i think if it was cancelled earlier, then you dont have to do anything here.",

      "message": "we could get a NULL here also if this is called post cancel or end. So the NULL check basically acts as checking whether or not the mWorkerThread was canceled previously. I guess we could check the canceled parameter to ascertain this information also.",
